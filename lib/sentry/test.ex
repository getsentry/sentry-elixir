defmodule Sentry.Test do
  @moduledoc """
  Utilities for testing Sentry reports.

  ## Usage

  This module is based on **collecting** reported events and then retrieving
  them to perform assertions. You can start collecting events from a process
  by calling `start_collecting_sentry_reports/0`. Then, you can use Sentry
  as normal and report events (through functions such as `Sentry.capture_message/1`
  or `Sentry.capture_exception/1`). Finally, you can retrieve the collected events
  by calling `pop_sentry_reports/0`.

  ## Examples

  Let's imagine writing a test using the functions in this module. First, we need to
  start collecting events:

      test "reporting from child processes" do
        parent_pid = self()

        # Collect reports from self().
        assert :ok = Test.start_collecting_sentry_reports()

        # <we'll fill this in below...>
      end

  Now, we can report events as normal. For example, we can report an event from the
  parent process:

      assert {:ok, ""} = Sentry.capture_message("Oops from parent process")

  We can also report events from "child" processes.

      # Spawn a child that waits for the :go message and then reports an event.
      {:ok, child_pid} =
        Task.start_link(fn ->
          receive do
            :go ->
              assert {:ok, ""} = Sentry.capture_message("Oops from child process")
              send(parent_pid, :done)
          end
        end)

      # Start the child and wait for it to finish.
      send(child_pid, :go)
      assert_receive :done

  Now, we can retrieve the collected events and perform assertions on them:

      assert [%Event{} = event1, %Event{} = event2] = Test.pop_sentry_reports()
      assert event1.message.formatted == "Oops from parent process"
      assert event2.message.formatted == "Oops from child process"

  Starts collecting events from the current process.

  This function starts collecting events reported from the current process. If you want to
  allow other processes to report events, you need to *allow* them to report events back
  to the current process. See `allow/2` for more information on allowances. If the current
  process is already *allowed by another process*, this function raises an error.

  The `context` parameter is ignored. It's there so that this function can be used
  as an ExUnit **setup callback**. For example:

      import Sentry.Test

      setup :start_collecting_sentry_reports

  For a more flexible way to start collecting events, see `start_collecting/1`.

  Starts collecting events.

  This function starts collecting events reported from the given (*owner*) process. If you want to
  allow other processes to report events, you need to *allow* them to report events back
  to the owner process. See `allow/2` for more information on allowances. If the owner
  process is already *allowed by another process*, this function raises an error.

  ## Options

    * `:owner` - the PID of the owner process that will collect the events. Defaults to `self/0`.

    * `:cleanup` - a boolean that controls whether collected resources around the owner process
      should be cleaned up when the owner process exits. Defaults to `true`. If `false`, you'll
      need to manually call `cleanup/1` to clean up the resources.

  ## Examples

  The `:cleanup` option can be used to implement expectation-based tests, akin to something
  like [`Mox.expect/4`](https://hexdocs.pm/mox/1.1.0/Mox.html#expect/4).

      test "implementing an expectation-based test workflow" do
        test_pid = self()

  Pops all the collected events from the current process.

  This function returns a list of all the events that have been collected from the current

  After this function returns, the current process will still be collecting events, but
  the collected events will be reset to `[]`.
