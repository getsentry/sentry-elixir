## 11.0.1

#### Various improvements

- `Sentry.OpenTelemetry.Sampler` now works with an empty config ([#915](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-elixir/pull/915))

## 11.0.0

This release comes with a beta support for Traces using OpenTelemetry - please test it out and report any issues you find.

### New features

- Beta support for Traces using OpenTelemetry ([#902](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-elixir/pull/902))

  To enable Tracing in your Phoenix application, you need to add the following to your `mix.exs`:

  ```elixir
  def deps do
    [
      # ...
      {:sentry, "~> 11.0.0"},
      {:opentelemetry, "~> 1.5"},
      {:opentelemetry_api, "~> 1.4"},
      {:opentelemetry_exporter, "~> 1.0"},
      {:opentelemetry_semantic_conventions, "~> 1.27"},
      {:opentelemetry_phoenix, "~> 2.0"},
      {:opentelemetry_ecto, "~> 1.2"},
      # ...
    ]
  ```

  And then configure Tracing in Sentry and OpenTelemetry in your `config.exs`:

  ```elixir
  config :sentry,
    # ...
    traces_sample_rate: 1.0 # any value between 0 and 1.0 enables tracing

  config :opentelemetry, span_processor: {Sentry.OpenTelemetry.SpanProcessor, []}
  config :opentelemetry, sampler: {Sentry.OpenTelemetry.Sampler, []}
  ```
- Add installer (based on Igniter) ([#876](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-elixir/pull/876))

### Various improvements

- Tweak credit card regex handling for OTP-28 ([#898](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-elixir/pull/898))

# Changelog

## 10.10.0

This release adds Telemetry crash reporting, fixes compatibility with Erlang/OTP 28, and includes several bug fixes.

### New features

- Add Telemetry integration for capturing Telemetry crash events in Sentry (#887 by @whatyouhide)
- Add `:owner` option for check-ins, providing more control over cron monitoring (#879 by @Miradorn)

### Bug fixes

- Fix regexes on Erlang/OTP 28 (#889 by @josevalim)
- Fix ignored exception in the default filter by correcting `Plug.Parsers.RequestTooLarge` reference (#884 by @mbaleczny)
- Fix hyperlink tag in `Sentry.LoggerBackend` moduledoc (#880 by @bjacquet)
- Remain compatible with new translation format to be introduced in Elixir 1.19 (#885 by @martosaur)

### Various improvements

- Update OTP and OS in CI (#882 by @solnic)

## 10.9.0

This release adds a bunch of new features and fixes a few papercut bugs.

### New features

- Add `:tags_from_metadata` option to `Sentry.LoggerHandler`. Use this to better structure reports that come from logs (#840 by @icehaunter).
- Add `:discard_threshold` option to `Sentry.LoggerHandler` to implement load shedding when the logger gets overloaded.
- If you want to use Elixir 1.18's new `JSON` module, now you can (#845).
- Add `:in_app_otp_apps` configuration option. This should replace `:in_app_module_allow_list` for most use cases, making configuration simpler (#854 by @solnic).
- Add support for per-module custom options for check ins. This means you can now configure single Oban (or Quantum) jobs with per-worker options such as timezones and more (#833 by @savhappy).
- Add a global `:extra` config that can be set at the `:sentry` application level (akin to `:tags` today).
- Improve Oban error reporting.

### Bug fixes

- We now deduplicate identical events significantly less, reducing the risk of not reporting events that are not duplicates.
- When dropping breadcrumbs (because of the limit being reached), we now retain *newest* breadcrumbs instead of older ones (#858 by @dajinchu).
- Ensure log messages are not captured with `:capture_log_messages` is `false` (#865 by @joladev).
- Normalize Oban exception reasons for better reports.

- Add upgrade guide links to the changelog (#659) by @axelson

## 10.0.2

### Various fixes & improvements

## 10.0.1

### Various fixes & improvements

- Fix reading of config in "mix sentry.package_source_code" (#653)

## 10.0.0

[9.x -> 10.0 Upgrade Guide](https://hexdocs.pm/sentry/upgrade-10-x.html)

- `:report_deps` now reports all loaded applications at the time the `:sentry` application starts. This is not a compile-time configuration option anymore.
- Add the `mix sentry.package_source_code` Mix task. See the upgrade guide for more information.
- Add `~r"/test/"` to the default source code exclude patterns (see the `:source_code_exclude_patterns` option).
- `:environment_name` now defaults to `production` (if it wasn't configured explicitly and if the `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable is not set).
- Hard-deprecate `:included_environments`. To control whether to send events to Sentry, use the `:dsn` configuration option instead. `:included_environments` now emits a warning if used, but will still work until v11.0.0 of this library.
- Hard-deprecate `:before_send_event` in favor of the new `:before_send`. This brings this SDK in line with all other Sentry SDKs.

## 9.0.0

[8.x -> 9.0 Upgrade Guide](https://hexdocs.pm/sentry/upgrade-9-x.html)

### Breaking changes

- Removed `Sentry.Sources`
- Removed `Sentry.Client`, as it's an internal module
- Removed the `Sentry.Event.sentry_exception/0` type
- Removed `Sentry.Event.add_metadata/1`
- Removed `Sentry.Event.culprit_from_stacktrace/1`
- Removed `Sentry.Event.do_put_source_context/3`
- Removed the `:async` value for the `:result` option in `Sentry.send_event/2` (and friends)
- Removed `Sentry.CrashError` â€”Â now, crash reports (detected through `Sentry.LoggerBackend`) that do not contain exceptions are reported as *messages* in Sentry
- Changed the shape of the `Sentry.Event` struct - check out the new fields (and typespec for `Sentry.Event.t/0`)

### Various fixes & improvements

- Add `Sentry.LoggerHandler`, which is a `:logger` handler rather than a `Logger` backend
- Make the `Sentry.HTTPClient.child_spec/0` callback optional
- Add `:all` as a possible value of the `:metadata` configuration option for `Sentry.LoggerBackend`
- Add `:all` as a possible value for the `:included_environment` configuration option
- Add `Sentry.Interfaces` with all the child modules, which are useful if you're working directly with the Sentry API

* Enhancements
  * Return a task when sending a Sentry event
  * Provide default scrubber for request body and headers (`Sentry.Plug.default_body_scrubber` and `Sentry.Plug.default_header_scrubber`)
  * Header scrubbing can now be configured with `:header_scrubber`

* Bug Fixes
  * Ensure `mix sentry.send_test_event` finishes sending event before ending Mix task

* Backward incompatible changes
  * `Sentry.capture_exception/1` now returns a `Task` instead of `{:ok, PID}`
  * Sentry.Plug `:scrubber` option has been removed in favor of the more descriptive `:body_scrubber`option, which defaults to newly added `Sentry.Plug.default_scrubber/1`
  * New option for Sentry.Plug `:header_scrubber` defaults to newly added `Sentry.Plug.default_header_scrubber/1`
  * Request bodies were not previously sent by default.  Because of above change, request bodies are now sent by default after being scrubbed by default scrubber.  To prevent sending any data, `:body_scrubber` should be set to `nil`
