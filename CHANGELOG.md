## 2.0.0 (2016-11-28)

* Enhancements
  * Return a task when sending a Sentry event
  * Provide default scrubber for request body and headers (`Sentry.Plug.default_body_scrubber` and `Sentry.Plug.default_header_scrubber`)
  * Header scrubbing can now be configured with `:header_scrubber`

* Bug Fixes
  * Ensure `mix sentry.send_test_event` finishes sending event before ending Mix task

* Backward incompatible changes
  * `Sentry.capture_exception/1` now returns a `Task` instead of `{:ok, PID}`
  * Sentry.Plug `:scrubber` option has been removed in favor of the more descriptive `:body_scrubber`option, which defaults to newly added `Sentry.Plug.default_scrubber/1`
  * New option for Sentry.Plug `:header_scrubber` defaults to newly added `Sentry.Plug.default_header_scrubber/1`
  * Request bodies were not previously sent by default.  Because of above change, request bodies are now sent by default after being scrubbed by default scrubber.  To prevent sending any data, `:body_scrubber` should be set to `nil`
