# Upgrade to Sentry 9.x

This guide contains information on how to upgrade from Sentry 8.x to Sentry 9.x. If you're on a version lower than 8.x, see the previous upgrade guides to get to 8.x before going through this one.

## Check Your Elixir Version

Sentry 9.0.0 requires Elixir 1.11+. If you're still running on Elixir 1.10 or lower, use Sentry 8.x or lower.

## Remove DSN Query Params

Before 9.0.0, the Sentry Elixir library supported one way of passing configuration through **query parameters** in the configured Sentry DSN. This is **not supported** anymore in 9.0.0.

To upgrade:

  1. Remove query parameters from your configured Sentry DSN.
  1. Set the values for those parameters as normal configuration, either via the application environment, or via environment variables.

For example:

```elixir
# In config/config.exs

# Replace this:
config :sentry,
  dsn: "https://public:secret@app.getsentry.com/1?server_name=my-server"

# with this:
config :sentry,
  dsn: "https://public:secret@app.getsentry.com/1",
  server_name: "my-server"
```

## Make Sure the Environment Name Is Configured

Sentry now requires the `:environment_name` configuration to be set, since the default was causing potential issues (such as [#524](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-elixir/issues/524)). To fix this, configure `:environment_name` or set the `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` system environment variable.

## Fix Your Environment Variables

Sentry 9.0.0 stops using many "magic" system environment variables for configuration. These were environment variables prefixed with `SENTRY_`.

If you were using these environment variables, you'll either need to configure the corresponding setting through the application environment, or you'll need to *read* those variables yourself (at **runtime**).

For example, if you were setting `SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL`, you'll have to do something like:

```elixir
# In config/runtime.exs
config :sentry,
  log_level: System.fetch_env!("SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL")
```

We strongly recommend you do this in `config/runtime.exs` so that you'll read the system environment when starting your application. This is going to work both for local development as well as in [Mix releases](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.15.4/Mix.Tasks.Release.html).

This is the new system environment variables configuration:

| System environment variable | Corresponding configuration setting | Supported in 9.0.0+           |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `SENTRY_SERVER_NAME`        | `:server_name`                      | ❌                            |
| `SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL`          | `:log_level`                        | ❌                            |
| `SENTRY_CONTEXT_LINES`      | `:context_lines`                    | ❌                            |
| `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT_NAME`   | `:environment_name`                 | ❌ — use `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` |
| `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`        | `:environment_name`                 | ✅                            |
| `SENTRY_DSN`                | `:dsn`                              | ✅                            |
| `SENTRY_RELEASE`            | `:release`                          | ✅                            |

## Stop Using `{:system, var}`

Sentry used to support setting configuration options to `{:system, var}` in order to read `var` from the system environment at runtime. This behavior was there to compensate for releases before [Mix releases](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.15.4/Mix.Tasks.Release.html) were introduced.

With Mix releases, you can use `config/runtime.exs` to have runtime configuration that works both within releases and using Mix (like during local development).

To fix this, remove all the `{:system, var}` values from the Sentry configuration, move those options to `config/runtime.exs`, and use normal `System` functions to read the environment (such as `System.fetch_env!/1`).

```elixir
# Before, in config/config.exs ❌
config :sentry,
  # ...,
  environment_name: {:system, "SENTRY_ENV"}

# Now, in config/runtime.exs ✅
config :sentry,
  # ...,
  environment_name: System.fetch_env!("SENTRY_ENV")
```

## Fix Compile-Time Configuration

Some configuration settings that Sentry supports are needed to **compile** Sentry itself. Before 9.0.0, you could change the value of these settings (such as `:enable_source_code_context`) at runtime, but it would have no effect. It would only do something if you were to change the value at compile time, and then you'd *recompile* Sentry itself.

Elixir v1.10.0 introduced [`Application.compile_env/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.15.4/Application.html#compile_env/2) however. This means that we were able to turn those settings into explicit *compile-time settings*. If you change the value of any of these settings now and forget to recompile Sentry, Mix will yell at you.

The fix for this is simple: do what Mix says.

The settings that are now *compile-time settings* are:

  * `:enable_source_code_context`
  * `:root_source_code_paths`
  * `:report_deps`
  * `:source_code_path_pattern`
  * `:source_code_exclude_patterns`

## Stop Using `Sentry.Sources`

`Sentry.Sources` was meant to be private API and has been removed. Its functionality is very specific to Sentry, and it's not a good general mechanism to retrieve source code. This way, we can also have the freedom to improve this functionality without making potential breaking changes to the API of this library.

## Stop Using `result: :async`

We removed the `:async` possible value from the `:result` option of `Sentry.Client.send_event/2`. Instead, you can spawn a task yourself.

If you had something like this before:

```elixir
{:ok, sentry_task} = Sentry.capture_exception(my_exception, result: :async)

# Do other stuff...

Task.await(sentry_task)
```

you can now replace it with something like:

```elixir
# Start a supervisor for this somewhere, maybe in your application's
# start/2 callback.
{:ok, _} = Task.Supervisor.start_link(name: SentryAsyncSupervisor)

{:ok, sentry_task} =
  Task.Supervisor.async_nolink(fn ->
    Sentry.capture_exception(my_exception, result: :async)
  end)

# Do other stuff...

Task.await(sentry_task)
```
